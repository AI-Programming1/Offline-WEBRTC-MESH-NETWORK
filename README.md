# Offline-WEBRTC-MESH-NETWORK
An offline WebRTC Mesh Networking utilizing SDP Exchange
-------------------------------------------------------------
Two beta versions exist labeled with a (1) and a (2).
Both with there own flaws, I test different A.I language models and this github repo where I will store all programs it can create.
This in entirely written in JavaScript and doesn't source any online libraries as it is completely usable on LAN only.
